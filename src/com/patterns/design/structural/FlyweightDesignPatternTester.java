//enables use sharing of objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently
//A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously. 
//The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context.
//we can use it when we need a large number of similar objects that are unique in terms of only a few parameters and most of the stuffs are common in general
//also used when need to control the memory consumption by large number of objects � by creating fewer objects and sharing them across.
//A flyweight objects essentially has two kind of attributes � intrinsic and extrinsic.
	//An intrinsic state attribute is stored/shared in the flyweight object, and it is independent of flyweight�s context. As the best practice, we should make intrinsic states immutable.
	//An extrinsic state varies with flyweight�s context, which is why they cannot be shared. Client objects maintain the extrinsic state, and they need to pass this to a flyweight object during object creation.
